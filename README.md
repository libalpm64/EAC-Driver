EAC-Driver
Bypasses Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC). Got bored, so I decided to release it.

Overview
This project provides a basic framework for bypassing EAC. While it's functional, it's primarily intended as a starting point for learning or further development.

Note: To implement this, you need to understand the basics of:

IOCTL calls
Memory reading from user-mode to the driver
Without this knowledge, youâ€™re unlikely to get it working properly.

Warning
This is likely to be detected shortly after this release. Use it as a base for learning or experimentation, not for long-term use.
